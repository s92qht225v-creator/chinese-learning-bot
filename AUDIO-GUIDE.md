3. Change `dl=0` to `dl=1` at the end of URL

#### **Option C: Supabase Storage** (Recommended for production)

2. Create a bucket called `audio`
3. Make it public
4. Upload files
5. Copy the public URL

#### **Option D: Any CDN**

### Step 2: Add Audio URLs in Admin Panel

## Audio File Recommendations

- **Format**: MP3 or OGG (MP3 is most compatible)
- **Quality**: 128kbps is fine for speech
- **Length**: Keep files short (1-5 seconds per word)
- **Naming**: Use pinyin for easy organization (e.g., `nihao.mp3`)

## Example Audio URLs

Here are some example formats that work:

```
https://example.com/audio/nihao.mp3
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=ABC123&export=download
https://dropbox.com/s/abc123/nihao.mp3?dl=1
https://tnpxusgdmnhixcjdpufy.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/nihao.mp3
```

## Bulk Upload (For Many Files)

If you have hundreds of audio files, consider:

1. **Upload all to one place** (Supabase Storage, S3, etc.)
2. **Use consistent naming**: `word_pinyin.mp3`
3. **Script URL generation**: 
   ```javascript
   const baseUrl = 'https://example.com/audio/';
   const audioUrl = baseUrl + pinyin + '.mp3';
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio not playing?
- âœ… Check URL is publicly accessible (open in browser)
- âœ… Make sure it's a direct link to the file (not a download page)
- âœ… Check CORS is enabled on your hosting service
- âœ… Try a different browser

### CORS Error?
Some hosting services need CORS configuration:
- **Supabase**: Already configured
- **S3/R2**: Add CORS policy in bucket settings
- **Google Drive**: May have restrictions, use Supabase instead

## Next Steps

Want me to:
1. Add audio fields to Dialogues and Characters forms?
2. Set up Supabase Storage for you?
3. Create a bulk upload script?

Just let me know!
