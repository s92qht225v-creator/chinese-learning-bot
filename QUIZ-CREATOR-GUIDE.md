### Organizing Questions

## Troubleshooting

### "Please fill in all required fields!"

- Verify question text is filled
- For multiple choice: ensure at least one correct answer is marked
- For fill gap: both sentence and correct answer required

### "Invalid admin password"
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('adminPassword')`
- Re-enter correct password (default: admin123)
- Check admin password in `/public/admin/index.html` line 1395

### Questions not appearing in app
- Verify question saved successfully (check database)
- Ensure `lesson_id` is set if filtering by lesson
- Check HSK level filtering in quiz pages

### Preview not showing correctly
